Design Decisions
Login/Signup Page:
The first page features a simple and intuitive login/signup interface. The form collects essential details, such as email, password, and username, ensuring ease of access for users. The design is clean and uncluttered to make the onboarding process straightforward.

Home Page:
The home page is designed to show five chapters. The first chapter is unlocked and available to access, while the remaining chapters are locked and will unlock sequentially as the user progresses through the quiz. This gamified design encourages users to advance by completing each chapter.

Quiz Interface:
Upon starting the quiz, users are presented with the first question. They have the option to skip the question or submit their answer. This flexible design enhances user experience by allowing users to manage their quiz flow. The focus is on clarity and simplicity, with easy navigation between questions.

Completion Page:
Upon completing the quiz, a “Congrats” message is displayed, offering positive reinforcement. A button allows users to return to the home page to continue to the next available chapter or review their progress.

Color Scheme and Typography
Colors: A clean, minimalist palette of white and light grey has been chosen for the mockup to create a professional and modern look. The neutral tones provide a smooth background for interactive elements like buttons and progress indicators.

Font: The Alice font was selected for its readability and elegant appearance, ensuring that users can easily read both questions and instructions. The consistency of the font throughout the site maintains a cohesive feel.

Button and Interactive Elements
All interactive elements, such as the login, signup, answer, and skip buttons, are clearly marked and intuitive. Buttons follow a minimalist design, harmonizing with the overall theme of the website, ensuring that user actions are easy to identify.
