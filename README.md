# Quiz Website Mockup

## Overview
This project presents a mockup of a quiz website, designed to guide users through a seamless quiz experience. The mockup includes the following key pages:

- **Login/Signup Page**
- **Home Page with Chapters** (showing locked and unlocked states)
- **Quiz Page** (where users can answer or skip questions)
- **Completion Page** (with a congratulatory message)

## Design Decisions

### Login/Signup Page
> The first page features a simple and intuitive login/signup interface. The form collects essential details such as email, password, and username, ensuring ease of access for users. The design is clean and uncluttered, making the onboarding process straightforward.

### Home Page
> The home page is designed to showcase five chapters. The first chapter is unlocked and available for access, while the remaining chapters are locked and will unlock sequentially as the user progresses through the quiz. This gamified design encourages users to advance by completing each chapter.

### Quiz Interface
> Upon starting the quiz, users are presented with the first question. They have the option to skip the question or submit their answer. This flexible design enhances the user experience by allowing users to manage their quiz flow. The focus is on clarity and simplicity, with easy navigation between questions.

### Completion Page
> Upon completing the quiz, a congratulatory message is displayed, offering positive reinforcement. A button allows users to return to the home page to continue to the next available chapter or review their progress.

## Color Scheme and Typography

- **Colors:** A clean, minimalist palette of white, light grey and black has been chosen for the mockup to create a professional and modern look. The neutral tones provide a smooth background for interactive elements like buttons and progress indicators.
  
- **Font:** The Alice font was selected for its readability and elegant appearance, ensuring that users can easily read both questions and instructions. The consistency of the font throughout the site maintains a cohesive feel.

## Button and Interactive Elements
> All interactive elements, such as the login, signup, answer, and skip buttons, are clearly marked and intuitive. Buttons follow a minimalist design that harmonizes with the overall theme of the website, ensuring user actions are easy to identify.
